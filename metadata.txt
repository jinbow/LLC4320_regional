The model has 90 vertical levels, with about 1-m vertical resolution at the surface and 30 m down to 500 m, for better resolving the upper-ocean processes. The model has zero parameterized horizontal diffusivity. In the vertical direction, the K-profile parameterization (KPP; Large et al. 1994) is used for boundary layer turbulent mixing. The model is forced by the 6-hourly ERA-Interim atmosphere reanalysis. In addition, a synthetic surface pressure field consisting of the 16 most dominant tidal constituents is used to dynamically mimic the tidal forcing." ;

The model has 90 vertical levels, with about 1-m vertical resolution at the surface and 30 m down to 500 m, for better resolving the upper-ocean processes. The model has zero parameterized horizontal diffusivity. In the vertical direction, the K-profile parameterization (KPP; Large et al. 1994) is used for boundary layer turbulent mixing. The model is forced by the 6-hourly ERA-Interim atmosphere reanalysis. In addition, a synthetic surface pressure field consisting of the 16 most dominant tidal constituents is used to dynamically mimic the tidal forcing." ;
